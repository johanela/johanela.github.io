        <h2>Athenian Dominance</h2>
        <p>The Athenian dominance that began in the early-Fifth Century with the defeat of the Persian 
            began to wane by the end of the century. Discontent among the other city-states that made up
             the Delian League triggered by inequality and foreign affairs blunders by Athens ultimately 
             led to confrontation with the Peloponnesian League, culminating with the Peloponnesian War. 
             The war ended in 404 BCE with an Spartan victory over Athens. While Athens was able to recover 
             its autonomy following victory in the Corinthian War nearly 20 years later, it never regained 
             the power it held during the Fifth Century BCE. By 338 BCE, just under 100 years since the 
             beginning of the Peloponnesian War, Athens was fully under the control of Phillip II of Macedon. 
             Following the Macedonian defeats, subjugation by Rome and its successor states continued until 
             Athens’ ultimate capture by, and integration into, the Ottoman Empire in the mid-1400’s.</p>
        <h2>Population of Athens</h2>
        <p>Athens in the 5th century, had 60,000 natives. If one adds the slaves and the foreign population, 
            the number rises to 350,000 to 500,000 inhabitants, of whom 160,000 lived in the city and the rest 
            in the suburbs. This was likely the height of the population during the Golden Age of Athenian Democracy.</p>
        <h2>Athenian Influence</h2>
        <p>Athens continues to influence modern culture in terms of philosophy, art, and architecture. Athens was 
            the center of the Greek universe for over a century and its navy dominated the Agean Sea during this time, leading
            to booming trade and a strong Athenian economy.
        </p>
        <p>Even under Spartan dominance following the Peloponnesian War, Athens remained a center of:</p>
