                <div class="div5"><p>Due to our location in the Northern Hemisphere, the largest apertures are on the south and east sides of the building. This orientation requires the least amount of energy for lighting and cooling the building. Further, by placing the largest windows on the east and south walls we can further reduce the energy consumption. Smaller use than when the windows are on the east and west walls. The overhangs facing east and south reduce solar gains, especially during summer. Another advantage of the overhangs is that they also shield the walls and windows from water intrusion and protect building materials. In order to provide flood protection for decades to come, the building is located 7ft above the average flood level.</p></div>
                <div class="div6"><p>The concrete roofing system can withstand the intense wind and rainstorms that occur quite often in South Florida. Further, concrete is a low heat transfer material, which helps the interior stay cool even as the outside of the structure heats up. In order to balance the heat gained by the concrete, we worked with landscape. The trees around the building not only protect pedestrians from the sun, but also protect the building itself. These trees act like canopies that will increase humans comfort levels.</p>
                    <p>In the Northern Hemisphere, south facing shed roofs are one of the best options for solar panels. Like any other electronic device, solar panels are subject to voltage surges due to lightning. However, a competent installer can ensure the system is properly grounded to prevent surges. A lightning protection system can also be installed to provide additional protection.</p></div>
