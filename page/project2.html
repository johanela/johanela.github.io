                <div class="div9"><p>The Lincoln Corner Architectural Research Center is in Miami Beach just in the intersection of Lincoln Rd and Alton Rd. It was designed to invite not only researchers and people in the architectural field but also the community. The building has a 2250 sq ft alley and a 4558 sq ft breezeway/outdoor seating. By creating public spaces, we invite people to come in. Also, in the building located in the back we can find fire stairs. On the first floor you can find the first part of the Exhibition Gallery and the stairs would take you to the second part of the Exhibition. Also on the first floor is a bar/caf√© and a gift shop which provides the opportunity to buy a souvenir before you leave the building. Both are open to the public, even after hours. Further, the auditorium is located on the third floor and just outside of it there is a terrace with an overhang which will provide shade.</p></div>

                <div class="div10"><p>Whoever in the community can come a grab a cup a coffee without worrying if the main building is closed. The Lincoln Corner Architectural Research Center does not only fulfill the needs for the researchers, but also for the community.</p></div>
